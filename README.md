# GalaxyEfficientNets

We present the state of the art EfficientNets being used for Galaxy Morphology Classification. 

The directories contain models used for regression or classification. The [Other Networks](Other%20Networks) directory contains the classification problem attempted using other state of the art networks.

The dataset for the regression model can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge).

The dataset for the classification model can be downloaded [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/5vy5gcn5phkg6cw/GalaxyClassification.zip/file).
